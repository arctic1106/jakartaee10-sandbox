# Jakarta Persistence

Jakarta Persistence (aka JPA) is a standard of persistence and O/R mapping in Java environments. It includes a collection of simple and stupid APIs to execute literal query (aka JPQL), and also contains alternative Criteria APIs to build the query clause in type-safe Java codes.

Next we will explore the new features introduced in Jakarta Persistence 3.1(JPA 3.1).
